# Cirrus Language - Website Landing Page

This repository contains a simple, static landing page designed as an initial web presence for the Cirrus programming language. The site is built with plain HTML, CSS, and a minimal amount of JavaScript to serve as a clean and professional-looking placeholder.

Please note that this is a temporary solution. A more robust and feature-rich website is planned for the future, which will be developed using a modern technology stack to provide a better user experience and more extensive documentation.
